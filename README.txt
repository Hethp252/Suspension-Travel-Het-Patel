# Suspension Travel final project README
## Step one
* Type python suspension.travel.py rc_(any numbers between 0 and 2).csv
in anaconda to run the code.
## Step two
* The code will read the file with pandas.

* The code will plot 2 graphs using matplotlib.pyplot

# Reasoning for the code
* This code plots the suspension travel of a car which allows
me to analyze how much the suspension travels which I can use
to see how much ground clearance there is. So I can implement
any repairs or improvements I need to make to make the ground clearance larger,
so the car can go over higher obstacles.
